            <a href="/">unt.benwilcox.dev</a> is a website that can be used to view the
            previous semesters in which courses were offered. As far as I'm aware,
            there are no public or internal tools for gauging when certain courses
            can be taken; as an incoming sophomore, I made this website out of
            necessity for effectively planning my degree. There are around 8,900
            historical and current courses offered at UNT which can be viewed in
            this website.
          </p>
          <p>Essentially, this site is a synthesis of UNT course history information from two different university resources:</p>

              contains the previously taught courses of all 3,300+ faculty members
              at UNT. Combined, this is ~180,000 "Course Offerings."

              contains full "graduate" and "undergraduate" course catalogs for the
              past 15 years. Combined, these contain ~99,000 "Catalog Listings."

            its previous name. Additionally, the search uses "fuzzy matching" so
            that typos don't affect the search results.

            You can pin a course by clicking the thumbtack icon to the right of

          <h3 id="course-group-selector">Course Group Selector</h3>
          <p className="indent">
            The Course Group Selector is used to specify which group of Catalog
            Listings make up a "Course". The university sometimes changes the
            Course Code or Name of a course, so it is not trivial to track its
            occurrences over many years. Because of this, each "Course" in the
            Course List is actually many Catalog Listings grouped together.
          </p>
          <p className="indent">
            The Course Group Selector lets you choose which Catalog Listings to
            include or exclude from the broader "Course" they represent. I use an
            8-part grouping algorithm that is designed to effectively create
            Courses from all Catalog Listings, but it sometimes includes erroneous
            Listings; I suggest you use the Course Group Selector to check for
            these mistakes before using the site to plan future enrollment.

            Each element contains the Course Code, Course Name, link to the
            relevant catalog.unt.edu entry, and the number of Course Offerings
            linked to that Catalog Listing. Clicking on an element will toggle if
            it is included in the "Course."

          <div className="indent">

              The intersection between a course (row) and a year (column) is called
              a "Semester Cell." Each Cell contains four semester bars (described
              later). Each Cell's background can be shaded one of three different
              colors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Light Gray: There was a course catalog listing for this year.</li>
              <li>Black: There was no course catalog listing for this year.</li>
              <li>
                Dark Gray: All cells prior to 2011; no catalog data, only faculty's
                course offerings.

          <h4 id="semester-bars">Semester Bars</h4>
          <p className="indent">
            Each "Semester Bar" represents a possible semester a course could be
            offered. There are four Semester Bars in a year: Fall (Orange), Summer
            (Yellow), Spring (Green), Winter (Blue). A lighter shade means the
            course was not taught during that semester, while a darker shade means
            it was. You can click on a Semester Bar to view the courses offered
            during that semester in Course Display 2.

          <h4 id="granular-view">Granular View</h4>
          <p className="indent">
            "Granular View" divides each Semester Bar up into "Specific
            Semesters" (e.g., "Summer 3W1" or "Fall 8W2"). There are only four
            "Broad Semesters", but there are 29 unique "Specific Semesters"
            mentioned throughout all Course Offerings. The increased granularity
            is useful for planning Summer classes in particular.

          The university sometimes changes the Course Code or Name of a course, so it is not trivial to track its occurrences over many years. Because of this, each "Course" in the Course List is actually many Catalog Listings grouped together, and each Course Offering is paired with a Catalog Listing.

          you can find the specific python files that contain the code for this.
        </p>
        <p className="indent">
          However, accurate matching is difficult for edge cases and there are still mistakes and oversights in the grouping and pairing of courses; do not trust each course in the Course List to contain a 100% accurate list of all historical course options. Having meticulously combed through my data, I believe my algorithms are about 95% accurate in creating Course Groups. Use the{' '}

          Using these algorithms, every course in the Course List contains an average of 11 catalog listings and 20 course offerings across its history.
